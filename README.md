# ATM-Management-System
The ATM Management System is a software project designed to enhance the user experience in accessing and managing their bank accounts, specifically for cash withdrawals. Here's a more detailed breakdown of its functionalities:

1. **User Authentication:** The system requires users to insert their ATM card and enter a verified Personal Identification Number (PIN). This step ensures that only authorized individuals have access to the account.

2. **Transaction Selection:** Once authenticated, users can choose the withdrawal option from the menu. This initiates the process of retrieving cash from the account.

3. **Withdrawal Process:** Users input the desired withdrawal amount, and the system dispenses the requested cash in the form of 50s, 100s, and 500s. This provides flexibility and convenience for users with various cash needs.

4. **Multiple Transactions:** The system allows users to perform multiple transactions in a single session, accommodating various financial needs without the need for repeated authentication.

5. **Security Measures:** Security is a top priority. The system ensures a secure connection between users and the bank servers, safeguarding sensitive information throughout the transaction process. This includes PIN validation, ensuring that only the rightful account holder can initiate transactions.

6. **Automation:** The entire process, from PIN validation to transaction completion, is automated. This reduces the risk of human errors, enhances efficiency, and provides a seamless experience for users.

7. **User-Friendly Interface:** The system is designed to be user-friendly, with a straightforward interface that allows users to navigate through the menu options easily.

8. **Real-time Updates:** Users receive real-time updates on their account balances after each transaction, providing transparency and enabling them to manage their finances effectively.

In summary, the ATM Management System aims to provide a secure, efficient, and user-friendly platform for individuals to access their bank accounts and conduct cash withdrawals. The emphasis on security and automation ensures a reliable and convenient experience for users in managing their financial transactions.
