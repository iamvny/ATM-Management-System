# ATM-Management-System
"The ATM Management System allows users to access bank accounts for cash withdrawals. By inserting the ATM card, verifying PIN, and selecting withdrawal amounts, users receive cash in 50's, 100's, and 500's. This secure system ensures encrypted connections between users and bank servers, automating transactions from PIN validation to completion."
